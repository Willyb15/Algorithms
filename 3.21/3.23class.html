<!-- Make an array.
Fill the array with objects.
Make the objects using a constructor.
The objects should be any 10 US cities.
The objects should have the following properties:
- population
- state
- sq. feet
- pop/density
- method that takes an argument and prints to the screen if the population is larger or smaller.

Also try...
Make the method a prototype -->
